[Source](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-xrdp-on-ubuntu-18-04/)

### Install `xrdp` server

```
$ sudo apt install xrdp
```

### Enabling `i3` upon login using `rdp` for single user

1. Edit the file `~/.xsessions` or create a new file
2. Add the following lines to the file

    ```
    #!/bin/sh

    exec /usr/bin/i3
    ```
3. Restart `xrdp` service

    ```
    $ sudo systemctl restart xrdp.service
    ```

Now you can connect to this machine into `i3` using any RDP client.

### Enabling `i3` upon login using `rdp` for all users

Keep in mind that `i3` RDP login has been mapped to your account only.
If you want to set `i3` as the default RDP login for all, edit the file `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh` and do steps 2 and 3 as mentioned in the previous section.
