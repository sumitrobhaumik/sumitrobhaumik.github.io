By no means is this better than the official Arch Installation Wiki , but it's really verbose and considers EVERY possible edge case, which is good in some cases. I generally follow the guide by itsfoss which uses saner assumptions but I would like to add a few more points to it. Those who are reading this guide, I would encourage you to read both of them. Read itsfoss guide for a basic understanding, and the Arch Wiki in case you are facing issues. Assumptions You have installed grub and you are just about to reboot into your new arch install. You are chroot 'ed into your partition. Before you reboot, these are somethings you should do. Enable Networking Enable networking, otherwise you won't have network access after the reboot. Install networkmanager pacman -S networkmanager Enable networkmanager as a service systemctl enable NetworkManager.service Enable SSH I typically enable ssh in all my machines. You can skip this step if you don't want to. pacman -S openssh Enable ssh as a service systemctl enable sshd.service Create an account You should create a new account as you don't want to ssh as root , as it's heavily discouraged. useradd -m <username> passwd <username> You can choose to give this account root permission as well. Enable swap I typically keep a swap partition. As this point, it's just a force of habit, even though I don't use the hibernate feature on my machines. You can also use a swap file which you can check out here mkswap /dev/<swap partition> swapon -a Edit fstab I typically have a different partition for root and home . It has some advantages, like if your home fills up due to some bug your OS can still work since root is free. Also, you can create an image of your home partition easily. So make sure to edit your fstab such that on reboot both your home and swap partition are automatically mounted. The way to do it is as follows Check your partition UUID by typing blkid Make an entry in /etc/fstab with the UUID UUID=<the partition ID> /home ext4 defaults 0 0 UUID=<swap ID> swap swap defaults 0 0 Save and exit Now you can reboot and enjoy your Arch install. Post Installation I like to install the following programs to make my life easier in Arch. An AUR Helper - yay yay helps us download and install applications from the Arch User Repository , which is a community-maintained list of package descriptions for popular applications which are not available on the official Arch repository. Once you get used to AUR, you will not want to download and compile from source again. There are multiple AUR helpers; i decided to use yay simply because it's currently the most popular. To install yay , you need to install the git and base-devel package, clone yay and then install it. pacman -S base-devel git git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git cd yay makepkg -si Now you can install any package from the AUR using yay using the command yay -S <package name> .

But, it's not the case with the hotkey manager. It's coupled closely with the i3 window manager, and I don't think it can be closed/terminated. However, it doesn't mean you can't use a different hotkey manager. This is where Simple X Hotkey Daemon , or sxhkd comes into the picture, which is a standalone hotkey daemon. The parser of sxhkd is more powerful than i3's parser, thus you can perform some complicated keybinds. Being standalone, you can use this with other window managers as well. How to switch to sxhkd? I would suggest you read through the sxhkd manual and project page first. But the basic structure of a keybind looks like this key combination command That is, you start a line with a desired key combination, and in the next line you write the command, starting with a whitespace. For adapting your i3 commands, all your keybinds need to be appended by i3-msg For example, in i3, you have a command to kill the current window. It's usually like this bindsym $mod+shift+q kill In sxhkd, it should be written as follows super + shift + q i3-msg kill Now you can start porting all your commands from the i3 config to the sxhkd config. To take things slow, I'll suggest to port commands in groups, that is, first you port the movement keys, check out whether it's working, and then port the window adjustment keys. Porting it this way makes debugging easier. Things to keep in mind For i3 to properly work, you still need to keep a minimum viable i3 config file, which is this # i3 config file (v4) set $mod Mod4 Without this, i3 will not work and throw an error. This behaviour is documented here . Also, sxhkd is case sensitive, unlike i3. Shift is not a valid key, while shift is. Conclusion That's it.

This is mainly because I wanted to see how well does it work as a testbed. So far, development has been quite smooth. Opening large files can take a while but the delays are nothing too serious. All my requirements are satisfied. Content Generation I'm actually using a minimal static site generator called ssg by Roman Zolotarev, which I heard about from Wolfgang's Channel . It's light because it's written in simple shell with 180 LOC, which is just hilarious. No dependancies or extra libraries (other than lowdown which converts markdown to html among other formats) Styling ssg simply spits out html without any styling. So I had to search for some nice css templates for markdown. I thought it would be easy but it took some time to find something decent but not too heavy. I settled for themes by Typora which is actually meant for their application; a markdown editor. The current theme that i'm using is called NexT . It took some manual tweaking to get it just right, specifically getting the code blocks right. Testing I'm testing the website on the same Pi using Python's built in web-server. It can be easily started like this python3 -m http.server By default, it runs at port 8000 and hosts the current directory. Domain name I bought this domain name from GoDaddy . That's almost the defacto domain market place in India. Remember to properly redirect your domain to your host, otherwise your site will be unreachable.

To truly embrace this ideology, you have to use Arch Linux, and being me, I was just too afraid to try it out. I eventually did, but that's for another day. Ubuntu Desktop has a minimal installation option but I it's still not minimal enough. The only way forward is to install the server edition of Ubuntu and then install your graphical environment. I've decided to use the i3 window manager. Assumptions You have a basic Ubuntu installation, possibly Ubuntu Server 20.04 You have set up proper network connectivity You have root access Pre-installation Steps We need to have the building blocks of a graphical UI, for which we need xorg . sudo apt install xorg xinit We now need to be able to compile i3 . We can use the i3 from apt , but I prefer to use i3-gaps which looks a bit nicer and is unfortunately not availble in the repos. Hence, we need the following packages for compiling and making. sudo apt install git make gcc autoconf Now, we install all the dependancies of i3-gaps sudo apt install libpango1.0-dev libyajl-dev libstartup-notification0-dev \\ libev-dev libtool libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev \\ libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-cursor-dev \\ libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xrm-dev xutils-dev Installing i3 Source Now that our build environment is ready, we can compile and install i3 There are 3 popular versions of i3 that I know of The original i3 i3-gaps by Airblader which has support for gaps between windows i3-gaps by resolved which has support for rounded corner for windows I prefer installing i3-gaps by resolved. However, the installation procedure is the same for all variants. Also, this might be a few commits behind i3-gaps . So clone, make and install i3 git clone https://github.com/resloved/i3 cd i3 autoreconf --force --install rm -rf build mkdir build cd build ../configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc make sudo make install At this point, your i3 installation is complete. Note : In case you get a dependancy error (there shouldn't be any), read the error output carefully. Install the missing packages and repeat the above step from scratch. Enabling i3 to run after login Till now, your i3 is ready but you need a way to initiate it after logging in. Which is why we installed xinit . Create ~/.xinitrc and edit it as follows #!/bin/sh exec /usr/bin/i3 Run startx in the terminal Your i3 WM should start up Now you have a minimal install of Ubuntu, running i3 . Conclusion Keep in mind, this setup is so barebones that some functions, that we take for granted in a standard \"bloated\" DEs, are missing. You need to create scripts for them OR find lightweight alternatives. Some lightweight alternatives which I use are Status-bar - polybar Login manager or a display manager - lightdm Program launcher - rofi Poweroff/reboot/logout menu - rofi again Display auto-detection system - xrandr Notification manager - dunst Wallpaper manager - nitrogen Compositor - picom Audio control - pavucontrol A good thing about all the above mentioned programs is that they are highly customizable, so you can set it exactly how you want it. You can think that you are creating your own desktop environment. Setting this up can be time-consuming, but you can be assured that there are no unneccessary backgroud processes.

This is mainly because of two reasons. nnn is much faster than ranger . This difference is specially noticable when using them on a Raspberry Pi. Scripting is much easy in nnn Having said that, I do like ranger in one regard; quick previews that work out of the box. Also, the application looks more like a traditional GUI file manager. nnn , on the other hand, has a more spartan appearance; only one pane compared to ranger 's three-pane interface. This guide should help you easily transition from ranger to nnn . Navigation is still the same. I'll suggest to look at the keybindings page with ? . It's small and easy to look at, unlike ranger 's 1000 line keybinding list. I'm mainly putting a list of actions that I commonly use and their corresponding key. Action list Select and deselect - space Bulk rename current directory - r This will open a file in your preferred editor You can choose to edit the filenames you want to You can also selectively chose to rename files using space Rename current file - ^r Edit current file in preferred editor - e Delete current file - x Exit at current - !

It's because I shifted from ssg to mkdocs . It is not a fault of ssg , but rather a fault of mine. I just can't write good CSS. I was initially using a hacked CSS from typora themes , but it had lots of, um, \"pizza crust\" (just a methphor, I eat all the crust). And upon receiving feedback from my friend about the site's general lack of appeal, I thought it's time for a change. Meanwhile, I also developed a two other sites using another static site generator, called mkdocs , which was primarily developed to create documentation pages for projects. However, I was pleasantly surprised at its flexibility in creating good blog sites; mainly in its ability to change the top navigation bar. Sure, it doesn't have the customizability of hugo or jekyll , but do you really need them at the end of the day? To leverage ssg , one needs to invest a lot of time to create a good CSS, which I didn't have. So, I said, f**k this, time to abandon ship. And I decided to change the site generator from ssg to mkdocs . The jump didn't take much time; it was around 10-15 min of work, and I'm happy with the result. Mkdocs isn't magical. Not everything is perfect. Few things which don't work for me, such as Most themes don't support quoted text Can't create custom 404 pages Can't disable the sidebar Can't use nested codeblocks, but was fixed by using the superfences plugin. Yes, mkdocs supports plugins. It's a bit finicky about relative paths But I can look past these faults. The main advantage is that mkdocs does not fight me. I hope this workflow has come to stay.","title":"Website Update"},{"location":"blog_posts/site_update/#website-update","text":"As you can see, the website has been drastically changed.
