By no means is this better than the official Arch Installation Wiki , but it's really verbose and considers EVERY possible edge case, which is good in some cases. I generally follow the guide by itsfoss which uses saner assumptions but I would like to add a few more points to it. Those who are reading this guide, I would encourage you to read both of them. Read itsfoss guide for a basic understanding, and the Arch Wiki in case you are facing issues. Assumptions You have installed grub and you are just about to reboot into your new arch install. You are chroot 'ed into your partition. Before you reboot, these are somethings you should do. Enable Networking Enable networking, otherwise you won't have network access after the reboot. Install networkmanager pacman -S networkmanager Enable networkmanager as a service systemctl enable NetworkManager.service Enable SSH I typically enable ssh in all my machines. You can skip this step if you don't want to. pacman -S openssh Enable ssh as a service systemctl enable sshd.service Create an account You should create a new account as you don't want to ssh as root , as it's heavily discouraged. useradd -m <username> passwd <username> You can choose to give this account root permission as well. Enable swap I typically keep a swap partition. As this point, it's just a force of habit, even though I don't use the hibernate feature on my machines. You can also use a swap file which you can check out here mkswap /dev/<swap partition> swapon -a Edit fstab I typically have a different partition for root and home . It has some advantages, like if your home fills up due to some bug your OS can still work since root is free. Also, you can create an image of your home partition easily. So make sure to edit your fstab such that on reboot both your home and swap partition are automatically mounted. The way to do it is as follows Check your partition UUID by typing blkid Make an entry in /etc/fstab with the UUID UUID=<the partition ID> /home ext4 defaults 0 0 UUID=<swap ID> swap swap defaults 0 0 Save and exit Now you can reboot and enjoy your Arch install. Post Installation I like to install the following programs to make my life easier in Arch. An AUR Helper - yay yay helps us download and install applications from the Arch User Repository , which is a community-maintained list of package descriptions for popular applications which are not available on the official Arch repository. Once you get used to AUR, you will not want to download and compile from source again. There are multiple AUR helpers; i decided to use yay simply because it's currently the most popular. To install yay , you need to install the git and base-devel package, clone yay and then install it. pacman -S base-devel git git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git cd yay makepkg -si Now you can install any package from the AUR using yay using the command yay -S <package name> .

But, it's not the case with the hotkey manager. It's coupled closely with the i3 window manager, and I don't think it can be closed/terminated. However, it doesn't mean you can't use a different hotkey manager. This is where Simple X Hotkey Daemon , or sxhkd comes into the picture, which is a standalone hotkey daemon. The parser of sxhkd is more powerful than i3's parser, thus you can perform some complicated keybinds. Being standalone, you can use this with other window managers as well. How to switch to sxhkd? I would suggest you read through the sxhkd manual and project page first. But the basic structure of a keybind looks like this key combination command That is, you start a line with a desired key combination, and in the next line you write the command, starting with a whitespace. For adapting your i3 commands, all your keybinds need to be appended by i3-msg For example, in i3, you have a command to kill the current window. It's usually like this bindsym $mod+shift+q kill In sxhkd, it should be written as follows super + shift + q i3-msg kill Now you can start porting all your commands from the i3 config to the sxhkd config. To take things slow, I'll suggest to port commands in groups, that is, first you port the movement keys, check out whether it's working, and then port the window adjustment keys. Porting it this way makes debugging easier. Things to keep in mind For i3 to properly work, you still need to keep a minimum viable i3 config file, which is this # i3 config file (v4) Without this, i3 will not work and throw an error. This behaviour is documented here . Also, sxhkd is case sensitive, unlike i3. Shift is not a valid key, while shift is. Conclusion That's it. Once you port all your commands, it should work just like before but with the added benefit of a decoupled window manager and hotkey daemon.","title":"Using Simple X Hotkey Daemon with i3"},{"location":"blog_posts/i3_sxhkd/#using-simple-x-hotkey-daemon-with-i3","text":"One thing about i3 which I like is that it gives you all the programs required to get working right away, which are primarily The window manager A status bar A hotkey manager The default status bar is good enough, but if you want, you can switch i3bar with another bar, such as Polybar, just by editing the i3 config file.

All my requirements are satisfied. Content Generation I'm actually using a minimal static site generator called ssg by Roman Zolotarev, which I heard about from Wolfgang's Channel . It's light because it's written in simple shell with 180 LOC, which is just hilarious. No dependancies or extra libraries (other than lowdown which converts markdown to html among other formats) Styling ssg simply spits out html without any styling. So I had to search for some nice css templates for markdown. I thought it would be easy but it took some time to find something decent but not too heavy. I settled for themes by Typora which is actually meant for their application; a markdown editor. The current theme that i'm using is called NexT . It took some manual tweaking to get it just right, specifically getting the code blocks right. Testing I'm testing the website on the same Pi using Python's built in web-server. It can be easily started like this python3 -m http.server By default, it runs at port 8000 and hosts the current directory. Domain name I bought this domain name from GoDaddy .

To truly embrace this ideology, you have to use Arch Linux, and being me, I was just too afraid to try it out. I eventually did, but that's for another day. Ubuntu Desktop has a minimal installation option but I it's still not minimal enough. The only way forward is to install the server edition of Ubuntu and then install your graphical environment. I've decided to use the i3 window manager. Assumptions You have a basic Ubuntu installation, possibly Ubuntu Server 20.04 You have set up proper network connectivity You have root access Pre-installation Steps We need to have the building blocks of a graphical UI, for which we need xorg . sudo apt install xorg xinit We now need to be able to compile i3 . We can use the i3 from apt , but I prefer to use i3-gaps which looks a bit nicer and is unfortunately not availble in the repos. Hence, we need the following packages for compiling and making. sudo apt install git make gcc autoconf Now, we install all the dependancies of i3-gaps sudo apt install libpango1.0-dev libyajl-dev libstartup-notification0-dev \\ libev-dev libtool libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev \\ libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-cursor-dev \\ libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xrm-dev xutils-dev Installing i3 Source Now that our build environment is ready, we can compile and install i3 There are 3 popular versions of i3 that I know of The original i3 i3-gaps by Airblader which has support for gaps between windows i3-gaps by resolved which has support for rounded corner for windows I prefer installing i3-gaps by resolved. However, the installation procedure is the same for all variants. Also, this might be a few commits behind i3-gaps . So clone, make and install i3 git clone https://github.com/resloved/i3 cd i3 autoreconf --force --install rm -rf build mkdir build cd build ../configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc make sudo make install At this point, your i3 installation is complete. Note : In case you get a dependancy error (there shouldn't be any), read the error output carefully. Install the missing packages and repeat the above step from scratch. Enabling i3 to run after login Till now, your i3 is ready but you need a way to initiate it after logging in. Which is why we installed xinit . Create ~/.xinitrc and edit it as follows #!/bin/sh exec /usr/bin/i3 Run startx in the terminal Your i3 WM should start up Now you have a minimal install of Ubuntu, running i3 . Conclusion Keep in mind, this setup is so barebones that some functions, that we take for granted in a standard \"bloated\" DEs, are missing. You need to create scripts for them OR find lightweight alternatives. Some lightweight alternatives which I use are Status-bar - polybar Login manager or a display manager - lightdm Program launcher - rofi Poweroff/reboot/logout menu - rofi again Display auto-detection system - xrandr Notification manager - dunst Wallpaper manager - nitrogen Compositor - picom Audio control - pavucontrol A good thing about all the above mentioned programs is that they are highly customizable, so you can set it exactly how you want it. You can think that you are creating your own desktop environment. Setting this up can be time-consuming, but you can be assured that there are no unneccessary backgroud processes.

It all started because I heard of a word called \"DNS leaks\". I was happy with my installation of a Pihole , which allows one to create a DNS sinkhole. All DNS queries in your local network can be processed by the Pihole, which compares the queries to a ad blocklist. If a query matches, then it's simply dropped. So in place of using your ISP's DNS server, use your own DNS server, which in this case, is the Pihole. This is quite useful when you are using devices where it's hard to use a dedicated adblocker, such as Android devices or SmartTVs. Keep in mind, you still need to use an upstream DNS server in the Pihole, which in my case was Cloudflare. The Rabbit Hole Everything was working quite well, till I found about a site called dnsleaktest . The premise of the site is that, even if you set your own DNS server, it's possible, due to network configuration issues, you might be using an OS/ISP specified DNS server, that is, you have \"leaked\" your DNS queries to a 3rd-party unintentionally. It's mentioned in their site that it's normally an issue for Windows machine, so I thought \"Yeah, no problem for Linux\", but I still decided to run the leak test. It was shocking to see that the website reported that i'm using two DNS services; Google's and my ISPs. There was no Cloudflare in sight. I tried to debug it using from the bottom up Is there a configuration issue on my Pihole? Is there a configuration issue on my router? Is there a configuration issue on my PC? Is it a single device issue or for all the devices? I saw that all my devices are using the same set of DNS services. I thought \"It's most probably an issue of my router\". Now, I was using an ASUS router, with its proprietary firmware. I heard it's a highly modified version of the open-source Tomato firmware, but I can't trust that it does not have it's own set of hardcoded DNS servers. In hindsight, I could have checked its internal routing table and seen that everything was fine, but I took no chances; I formatted the router with OpenWrt . Now, I should not have any DNS issue, right? WRONG! The problem still persisted. At this point, I consulted with the experts in the Pihole subreddit and they said this is an unexpected issue, there was no problem on my end. I didn't know what else can be changed. However, OpenWrt has a big advantage over default router firmwares; you can install external plugins. I decided to go down to packet level to investigate the issue using tcpdump . I created two DNS capture instances; one for internal traffic and one for external traffic. This was achieved by running the capture on different interfaces; in my case it was br-lan and eth0 . tcpdump -i <interface name> -w <capture file name> udp port 53 or tcp port 53 and dst not <pihole IP> and src not <pihole IP> I saw that nearly all internal DNS traffic were directed to the Pihole, and all external DNS traffic were directed to Cloudflare. The Deeper Problem Ok, let's step back for a second. It was a bit shocking. All external traffic was going to Cloudflare but dnsleaktest is reporting that it's going to Google. How is it possible? Is the website make a mistake? No, it wasn't. When I used a VPN, dnsleaktest told me I was using a DNS service which was outside my country. So something was happening at the ISP level. dnsleaktest mentioned that it's possible that some ISPs can use a technique called \"transparent DNS proxying\", or simply DNS hijacking . It involves capturing all DNS queries in real time, stripping the IP headers, replacing them with their own DNS server IPs and forwarding them. While returning the response, the original IP fields are restored and the user is left none the wiser. One solution for this to use a VPN, but it's just a bulky solution; throughput and latency can be affected by using a VPN. A better solution could be encrypting just the DNS queries, instead of the entire connection. That is exactly what DNS-over-HTTPS , or DoH, tries to provide. There are other alternatives, such as DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ), however I decided to go with DoH. There are some legitimate concerns about DoH, but that's a separate topic. After this realization, it simply became a matter of using the technology. Now, some applications/devices support DoH, however, the goal is the provide DoH to all devices inside the local network in my house. Fortunately, Cloudflare also provides the solution, called cloudeflared which is a simple daemon which connects to the Cloudflare DNS service over HTTPS. The only change that I have to do is to set the upstream DNS provider in my Pihole to the cloudflared application. All of it was done via Docker containers, which makes it very easy to deploy. There is a simple one-click docker-compose file available here . The End? Fine, so all problems solved, right? Well, almost. Remember a few paragraphs ago I mentioned that NEARLY all traffic was routed to my Pihole. Turns out that few devices use hard-coded DNS entries to reach their destination. You can't change them without formatting the device. So how do you solve this? The solution is \"transparent DNS proxying\". Yes, I will use the weapon which my own ISP used against me. OpenWrt, being a versatile firmware, has this feature. You simply need to write a few firewall rules, telling the router to capture all DNS traffic which are not going to my Pihole and \"repack\" them. iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING ! -s <pihole IP> -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to <pihole IP>:53 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING ! -s <pihole IP> -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to <pihole IP>:53 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE In OpenWrt terms, it's called masquerade . Conclusion This is was the final part of the puzzle, and with this all my DNS queries were properly served by my Pihole...for now. Just a simple word, which is \"dns leak\", sent me down a huge rabbit hole and taught me a lot. You might be wondering, why go to such lengths? The answer is \"Why not?

Updated on : 14.09.2021 Ever since I switched to i3 , I have simply become fascinated by terminal apps. Let's have a little discussion about them. What are terminal apps? These are apps which runs right inside the terminal. These apps don't have a GUI and are mostly keyboard-centric. Some terminal apps also accept mouse events. I've listed all the reasons why I think they are cool. Pros Extremely fast startup - This is because it's only sending a stream of characters to the terminal. Even TUI applications, which may seem like they have windows and panels, are just made up of characters. Low resource usage - There is no graphics library involved, so all the resource is used only for the task and nothing else. Less dependancies - Unlike GUI apps, which uses a GUI development library (GTK/Qt/Electron) to develop the frontend, terminal apps uses very simple libraries. They can be simple argument-based applications or TUI in nature. All of this results in a smaller codebase as well, which usually results in lesser chance of failure. Remote access is very easy as long as you have ssh - This is one of the biggest advantage of terminal apps over GUI apps. Open-source and community-driven - All the terminal apps that I have seen (which might be around ~100) are all open-source in nature and not under the control of a for-profit enterprise. So most of the decisions are based on performance and feature improvements, and not for increasing share-holder's profits and gathering telemetry. [BONUS] They make you look like a hacker /s Cons Esoteric design - There is a slight learning curve, and sometimes very high. However, once you get used the usage philosophy, it will be easier to use them. Exclusively keyboard-driven - This is one of the reasons why terminal apps scare novice PC users. Keep in mind they are designed to be used only via the terminal (Some modern terminal apps support mouse usage). It simply takes time to get used to it. Not mobile/tab friendly - While it's possible to install a terminal emulator, mobile and tabs are primarily designed for touch interface. As they are community-driven, only the popular ones are still actively developed. Others simply die out after getting abandoned by the maintainer. A lot of time needs to be invested to tune it to your liking, but it's a one time effort While terminal apps are certainly not everyone's cup of tea, once you get used to them, it's hard to leave them. Their sheer speed, operational capabilty and robustness is why I always try to find terminal alternative for common day-to-day applications.

Less dependancies - Unlike GUI apps, which uses a GUI development library (GTK/Qt/Electron) to develop the frontend, terminal apps uses very simple libraries. They can be simple argument-based applications or TUI in nature. All of this results in a smaller codebase as well, which usually results in lesser chance of failure. Remote access is very easy as long as you have ssh - This is one of the biggest advantage of terminal apps over GUI apps. Open-source and community-driven - All the terminal apps that I have seen (which might be around ~100) are all open-source in nature and not under the control of a for-profit enterprise. So most of the decisions are based on performance and feature improvements, and not for increasing share-holder's profits and gathering telemetry.

However, once you get used the usage philosophy, it will be easier to use them. Exclusively keyboard-driven - This is one of the reasons why terminal apps scare novice PC users. Keep in mind they are designed to be used only via the terminal (Some modern terminal apps support mouse usage). It simply takes time to get used to it. Not mobile/tab friendly - While it's possible to install a terminal emulator, mobile and tabs are primarily designed for touch interface. As they are community-driven, only the popular ones are still actively developed. Others simply die out after getting abandoned by the maintainer. A lot of time needs to be invested to tune it to your liking, but it's a one time effort While terminal apps are certainly not everyone's cup of tea, once you get used to them, it's hard to leave them. Their sheer speed, operational capabilty and robustness is why I always try to find terminal alternative for common day-to-day applications.
